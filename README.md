# USAA, Reg Tech


The company I choose for this assignment is USAA. According to USAA company history it was formed on June 20, 1922 by 25 Army officers to offer banking and insurance for the military and immediate family because of the need to cross boarders and maintain a bank acocunt, auto and health insurance as they travled aboard. USAA is funded by it's members purchasing products and services. 

According to the Consent Order issued this year, they are attempting to identify high risk customers during onboarding and through out there relationship. In 2020, USAA reported that their asset totaled $200 billion in 2020 with 13 million members during that time. 


According to SmartAsset.com, it states that USAA is primarily an online bank so they are available via phone. While not cheaper than Navy Federal, they are primarily cheaper with sending wires and are more favorable when having a checking account. USAA wire transfers are $0 for incoming and $20 for outgoing while the competitors charge for incoming and more for outgoing. https://smartasset.com/checking-account/navy-federal-vs-usaa-banking

While I couldn't find anything regarding their internal technologies, it's understood that there technoligies are subpar since the OCC fined USAA $40 million dollars because they failed to keep track of customers' high risk activities like international wires. 

USAA has a broad landscape in banking and insurance. Banking products are checking, debit card, remote deposit, wires, and ATM fee refunds. Fees are refunded based on the bank being primarily online. According to Forbes, "USAA harvests ideas through their Always On Ideas Platform" It's a way for employees to make USAA better. https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2018/09/30/how-to-build-a-culture-of-customer-experience-innovation-the-usaa-way/?sh=28e531002378  

According to USNews, USAA competitors are Navy Federal Credit Union, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, Chase (Chase Military Banking), and Security Service Federal Credit Unions. https://money.usnews.com/banking/articles/best-banks-and-credit-unions-for-the-military. With regards to Navy Federal specifically, using 2020, they had $135.7 billion in total assets and 9.9 million members. https://www.navyfederal.org/content/dam/nfculibs/pdfs/financial-reports/annual_report_2020.pdf. Navy Federal is catching up and it may be because of lack of negative news. 

Based on the most recent consent order to OCC has told USAA to stop accepting new members because they have not been following the OCC request to put in place guidelines to onboard and maintain high risk banking customers. 

If I utilize the findings provided in 2020, USAA tracks their success by the number of products/services they sell, number of members, and number of new members.  

My recommendation is for them to implement a reg tech program to automate the monitoring and flag based on certain perameters. This will assist in not onboarding high risk customers and/or identifying them quicker so they are reported and/or closed in a timely manner. Applying new technologies provided in Reg Tech will help lift the OCC demand so they can start boarding new customers and maintain their current products and services.
